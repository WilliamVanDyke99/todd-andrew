Requirements
1. Nested pipes

Thoughts
1. Instead of passing the whole side of a pipe to the command, I need to parse it again for I/O redirection.
   For example, "dmesg | grep wlp3s0" will work, but "dmesg | grep wlp3s0 > log" will not. I need to re-parse
   the tail of the pipe for it to detect the redirection.

2. Will the debug output get messed up if I have I/O redirection? I think it redirects all of the stdout to the file.
   Maybe it will also print debug messages to the file. Will need to check that.

3. Definitely need more testing, might also snazz it up a bit because I am ahead of schedule. Maybe add color to the prompt.

4. Code needs to be cleaned up a lot.
