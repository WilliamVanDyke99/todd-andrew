Requirements
1. Nested pipes

Thoughts
1. When using pipes, it prints the prompt twice.

2. Will the debug output get messed up if I have I/O redirection? I think it redirects all of the stdout to the file.
   Maybe it will also print debug messages to the file. Will need to check that.

3. Definitely need more testing, might also snazz it up a bit because I am ahead of schedule. Maybe add color to the prompt.

4. Code needs to be cleaned up a lot.
