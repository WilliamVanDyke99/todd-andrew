1 (if using pipe-check in pipe_exec). 
    Running "cat t.c | cat | cat | grep printf > outfile" creates an empty file named outfile. However,
    running "cat t.c | cat | cat | grep printf >> outfile" seems to work just fine? Also, running
    "cat t.c | cat | grep printf > outfile" seems to work. Not sure why the extra cat is breaking it.

2. Running less and quitting without going all the way to the bottom hangs. 
    (CAUSE = UNKNOWN)

3. (if using shell_exec in pipe_exec)
    Running a command with multiple pipes will print the user prompt multiple times. 
    (CAUSE = If there are multiple pipes, the tail will not run a specific command, but run the shell_exec again. So it doesn't exit until after the other processes. It prints another prompt when it exits.)
