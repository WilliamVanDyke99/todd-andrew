1. Running "cat t.c | grep while | more" does not work. It just outputs text to the screen instead of to more. However, replacing "more" with "less" works just fine.

2. Running something with multiple pipes prints the prompt the number of extra pipes you use.

3. Running less and quitting without going all the way to the bottom hangs.
