Bug in the middle case of rm_child(). First case is completely untested.
    (bug is when you remove the dir, you can still ls the deleted dir)

Bus in unlink.
    (bug is when you unlink a file, it removes the original file instead.)
        (My idea is that since they have the same inode number, it just removes the first one that it sees.)

rm_child() inside rmdir.c seems to be the culprit in both cases. I will have to look into it more.
