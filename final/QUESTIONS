1. mkdir and creat depend on enter_child.
    a. What does enter_child do?
    b. Show enter_child code. Explain entering DIR info into parent block.

2. rmdir and unlink depend on rm_child.
    a. What does it do?
    b. How do you remove the child if it is the last entry in parent block?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1a. It goes through the parent's data blocks until it finds one that has enough
    space for the new entry. It goes to the end of the block. If there is 
    enough space for the child, it shrinks the current last item down to its
    ideal length, moves past the old last item, and it places the new item at
    the end. Then it puts the block back. If the child won't fit in the block,
    it allocates a new block, then places the child at the first entry in the
    new block.

2a. It goes through the parent's blocks until it finds the child to remove.
    If it is the first and only entry in the block, it deallocates the block,
    subtracts BLKSIZE from the parent, then shifts the remaining blocks 
    (if any) down one spot. If it's not the only entry, or it is somewhere in 
    the middle, it deallocates the child inode, shifts the remaining inodes
    down one spot, then adds the child inodes rec_len to the last item in the
    block. If the child is the last item in the block, it deallocates the child
    inode, and adds the child's rec_len to the previous item (new last).
